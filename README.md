## COURSE:
CSIS 3375-001 : EX Design in Web & Mobile App

## PROFESSOR:
Padmapriya Arasanipalai Kandhadai

## TERM PROJECT:
An ultimate one-stop app for anime and manga fans, offering streaming, manga reading, and merch integration all in one place.

## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
You will be DESIGNING a full-fledged prototype in FIGMA for a novel app with high utility providing a transformative experience to the user. **THIS IS NOT A CODING PROJECT**. You are creating a hard-coded prototype in Figma prototype. The goal is to come up with a novel idea with high utility based on market background research, and identify the unique transformative experience you would provide for the user. Then, you will adhere to and apply design process discussed in class to create the prototype for this novel app.

The project idea can be any idea that excites and interests you as long as it is:
* It is a novel, marketable app - it has high novelty and utility compared to market competitors.
* It provides a unique, transformative experience for the user.

Note that the end deliverable of the prototype is not just novel in terms of User Interface but provides unique utility and experience. Also, I want teams to be ambitious, creative and think outside the box. If your prototype can be easily programmed with your CSIS 3175 knowledge alone, the prototype is not ambitious enough in terms of UI/UX user experience.
